# Kachemak Bay Seagrass Monitoring

###### README LAST UPDATED: 2025/06/04

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Overview

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a repository under active development to monitor the seasonal density, cover, and extent of seagrass in Kachemak Bay, Alaska.

### Objectives

-   Create a year-round dataset of seagrass density, cover, and extent with a particular focus on the north side of Kachemak Bay.

-   Pair presence/absence data with validation methods for further development of a Submerged Aquatic Vegetation Habitat Suitability Model for Kachemak Bay.

### Guiding Questions

-   What is the seasonality of seagrass in Kachemak Bay?

-   Are seagrass meadows changing in size or density through time?

### Current Status

This project is in active development and will change as additional data and analyses are included. The primary short-term goals for the project include:

-   Obtain bi-monthly seagrass density and cover data from Mud Bay.

-   Survey seagrass extent from the Homer Spit to Fox River Flats on a quarterly basis using field sampling and drones.

-   Create markdown summary document with major methods, inputs, and outputs.
