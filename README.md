# Kachemak Bay Seagrass Monitoring

###### README LAST UPDATED: 2025/08/07

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Overview

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a repository under active development to monitor the seasonal density, cover, and extent of seagrass in Kachemak Bay, Alaska.

### Objectives

-   Create a year-round dataset of seagrass density, cover, and extent with a particular focus on the north side of Kachemak Bay.

-   Pair presence/absence data with validation methods for further development of a Submerged Aquatic Vegetation Habitat Suitability Model for Kachemak Bay.

### Guiding Questions

-   What is the seasonality of seagrass in Kachemak Bay?

-   Are seagrass meadows changing in size or density through time?

### Current Status

This project is in active development and will change as additional data and analyses are included. The primary short-term goals for the project include:

-   Obtain bi-monthly seagrass density and cover data from Mud Bay on the north side of Kachemak Bay.

-   Survey seagrass extent from the Homer Spit to Fox River Flats on a quarterly basis using field sampling and drones.

-   Create markdown summary document with major methods, inputs, and outputs.

## Methods

### Location

Kachemak Bay is located within lower Cook Inlet in southcentral Alaska, USA. It is a high-latitude estuary comprised of multiple sub-bays and fjords bisected by the Homer Spit that roughly divides it into an 'outer' bay and 'inner' bay. The south side of the bay is largely rocky boulder and bedrock, with some smaller sediment substrate, and abuts the Kenai Mountain Range that provide glacial outflow in the spring and summer. The north side of the bay is largely mud, sand, and cobble, and is fed by several river systems flowing down from higher elevation peatlands. It is a macro-tidal system (\>8 m total tidal range) and tends to be well-mixed with some intermittent stratification dependent upon glacial outflow and season.

### Seagrass Communities

Seagrass (*Zostera marina*) can be found throughout the bay in intertidal and shallow subtidal fine sediments both in the inner bay, and south-shore outer bay, with the largest contiguous meadow located directly east of the Homer Spit in Mud Bay, extending eastward toward Fox River Flats. Seagrass throughout the bay is a mixture of contiguous and patchy distributions, and are known to support many marine and terrestrial species including herring and migratory shorebirds. Seagrass in Kachemak Bay has been survey intermittently since at least 2005, however, these efforts have been spatially and temporally disparate.

### Transect Surveys

To capture the extent and density of seagrass in Kachemak Bay, a combination of qualitative and quantitative surveys were conducted, with a focus on the the Mud Bay seagrass meadow. The intent was to create a method for quickly identifying the extent, relative density, and estimated absolute density of seagrass with a combination of repeated transects, quadrat densities, and stratified or haphazard percent cover estimations.

In brief, transects ranging from approximately 500 m to 1500 m were run in Mud Bay and the adjacent Coal Bay at spring low tide series from May to August 2025. Quadrats of 0.25^2^ m for seagrass shoot density were taken at regular intervals along each transect and GPS locations for each quadrat recorded. Five haphazardly selected shoots were selected from in and around each quadrat to measure longest blade length and width. Each quadrat was also assigned a semi-quantitative cover value in the context of the surrounding seagrass cover that included none (0%), trace (1%), sparse (2-10%), thin (11-25%), moderate (26-75%), and thick (76-100%). Regularly spaced cover values were also assigned along transects between quadrats in 3 m radius coverage areas using the same cover values. Nominal GPS locations for each cover observation were derived as evenly-spaced points between each known quadrat GPS location. Additional quadrat densities and cover values were taken haphazardly off transect lines to expand coverage areas. When observations were taken off a transect, GPS locations were recorded for each observation.
